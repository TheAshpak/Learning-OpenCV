In this repository i will be sharing my learning with OpenCV library for object detections.
Here in "OpenCv_Modules" i have uploaded 9 chapters as follows
1) How to read Image, Video and Webcam 
2) How to convert colored images into Gray scaled image, different blur and edge detection techniques like GaussianBlur, Canny edge detector
3) Cropping and resize images
4) Draw different shapes and write text on image
5) Change Prespective of image
6) stacking images vertically and Horizontally
7) Trackbar- for color detection
8) Edge detection and edge Highlight
9) Face detection with "CascadeClassifier" pre trained model
